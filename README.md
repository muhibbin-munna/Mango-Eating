# Mango Eating

Eating Mango is an AI based game where there are 2 players (one player is human and other is computer) trying to eat as much mango as possible. The one who eats more mangoes at the end of the game wins. The game moves are followed as:

- First of all, player one needs to input the number of Mango boxes where the quantity of Mangoes in each box is randomly generated.
- Player one (Human) selects the box which oneâ€™s Mangoes he/she will eat.
- After that AI selects which box it wants based on rules and tries to maximize the number of mangoes.
- This will continue until the last box is selected.



## Game Rules

- Player one (human) selects a box to eat the Mangoes of that box.
- If there are any remaining box/boxes before the box player one selected, player two (AI) will automatically eat the Mangoes of those boxes.
- Then, player two (AI) randomly selects the box from remaining boxes and eat the Mangoes of that selected box.
- If there are any remaining box/boxes before the box player two (AI) selected, player one (human) will automatically eat the Mangoes of those boxes.
- In the end, the player who will eat more quantity of Mangoes between them, will win the game.
